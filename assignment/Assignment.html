    <h1><center>Teleportation</center></h1>
    <h4><u><i>Introduction :</i></u></h4>
    <p><b>Teleportation is the hypothetical transfer of matter or energy from one point to another without traversing the physical space between them.</b> It is a common subject in science fiction literature and in other popular culture. Teleportation is often paired with time travel, being that the travelling between the two points takes an unknown period of time, sometimes being immediate. An apport is a similar phenomenon featured in parapsychology and spiritualism.</p>
    <h4><i><u>Etymology :</u></i></h4>
    <p>use of the term teleport to describe the hypothetical movement of material objects between one place and another without physically traversing the distance between them has been documented <mark> as early as 1878</mark></p>
    <p>American writer Charles Fort is credited with having coined the <Mark>word teleportation in 1931</Mark><del>[6]</del> to describe the strange disappearances and appearances of anomalies, which he suggested may be connected. As in the earlier usage, he joined the Greek prefix tele- (meaning "remote") to the root of the Latin verb portare (meaning "to carry").[7] Fort's first formal use of the word occurred in the second chapter of his 1931 book Lo!</p>

<p>Mostly in this book <del>I shall specialize upon indications that there exists</del>  a transportory force that I shall call Teleportation. I shall be accused of having assembled lies,yarns, hoaxes, and superstitions. To some degree I think so, myself. To some degree, I do not. I offer the data.</p>

<p>Teleportation is a common subject in science fiction literature, film, video games, and television.<br> The use of matter transmitters in science fiction originated at least as early as the 19th century.[9] An early example of scientific teleportation (as opposed to magical or spiritual teleportation) is found in the 1897 novel To Venus in Five Seconds by Fred T. Jane. Jane's protagonist is transported from a strange-machinery-containing gazebo on Earth to planet Venus hence the title.</p>
<p><mark><q>The earliest recorded story of a matter transmitter was Edward Page Mitchell's The Man Without a Body in 1877.</q></mark></p>
