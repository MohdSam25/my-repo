    <h4><u>Nuclear Fission:</u></h4>
    <ol type="i">
        <li><q>Fission reaction does not normally occur in nature</q></li>
        <li>Fission produces many highly radioactive particles</li>
        <li>The energy released by fission is a million times greater than that released in chemical reactions; but lower than the energy released by nuclear fusion</li>
        <li>One class of nuclear weapon is a fission bomb, also known as an atomic bomb or atom bomb</li>
    </ol>
    <H4><u>Nuclear Fussion:</u></H4>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li><q>Fusion occurs in stars, such as the sun</q></li>
        <li>Few radioactive particles are produced by fusion reaction, but if a fission “trigger” is used, radioactive particles will result from that</li>
        <li>The energy released by fusion is three to four times greater than the energy released by fission</li>
        <li>One class of nuclear weapon is the hydrogen bomb, which uses a fission reaction to “trigger” a fusion reaction</li>
    </ul>
